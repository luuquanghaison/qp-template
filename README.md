# qp-template
Project directory and LaTeX template for UBC STAT 548 Qualifying Paper reports

## Instructions for use:
1. Click "Use Template" at the top. This basically forks it into your own GitHub account. Don't have a GitHub, set one up now <https://github.com>. Note: this is hosted on servers outside Canada.
1. If necessary, [install git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
1. Clone your new repo to your machine somewhere.
1. At some point before you submit the report, [add me as a collaborator](https://help.github.com/en/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository).<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>
1. Use the directory structure to keep your project organized and use the LaTeX template in the `report` directory for your report. See below for more details on using the LaTeX template. See [my website](https://dajmcdon.github.io/teaching/stat548/) for details on my expectations for the report.
1. Commit and push your changes regularly. It serves as a back-up and lets me see how you progressed.
1. When you are ready to submit your report, commit with the message "submission for DJM review".
1. Send me an email confirming that you have submitted your report for review and marking.


## Details on directory usage
The short version: Each subdirectory has its own README file that tells you what goes in the directory.

The long(er) version: 
* Use the `report` directory to for all written portions of the project. 
* Use `references/qp-bib.bib` to keep your biliography up-to-date, and use it as the bib-file for your report. Feel free to keep PDFs of relevant papers here; `.gitignore` won't upload them to GitHub.
* Use `code` for any code you develop and `data` for any data you use (including output from your code). (There may be good reasons for not keeping your code in the same repository as your report, in which case let me know and invite me as a collaborator to that repo, as well.)

## Details on LaTeX template usage
* Compile `main.tex`, but make minimal edits. Most edits should be made in the compontent tex-files in the `sections/` directory.
* `header.tex` loads packages, tweaks formatting, etc. Edit as necessary, but do not change document formatting.
* `defs.tex` defines notation, custom commands, etc. Edit freely.
* Graphics go in `fig`.
